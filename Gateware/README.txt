Unity Gateware
------------

The gatware part of the Unity-framework contains a library of VHDL components.

The VHDL components are designed for handling the most common tasks when one is 
building mechatronic/robot control systems and interfacing them to PC's.

Some components are very simple, others are more advanced, most can configured using 
generics and some are build to the specific users needs by codegeneration 
scripts, e.g. python-scripts.
