node 1 (master)
node 2 (slave)
node 3 (slave)

------------------------------------
slave Reads:
node2 -> node 3 OUT	(RP)
node2 -> node 1 OUT	(RP)
node2 -> node 2 IN	(RP)
node2 -> node 2 OUT 	(WP)

slave writes:
node2 -> node2 OUT	(WP)

commit write (changes write pointer)
Read multiple (block auto commit to read pointer)

standard CWRM scheme perfect for slave nodes

------------------------------------
master Reads:
node1 -> node2 OUT	(RP)
node1 -> node3 OUT	(RP)
node1 -> node1 OUT	(WP)
node1 -> node2 IN	(WP)
node1 -> node3 IN	(WP)

node1 -> node1 IN	(RP) *

master Writes:

node1 -> node2 IN	(WP)
node1 -> node3 IN	(WP)
node1 -> node1 OUT	(WP)

node1 -> node1 IN	(RP)


*:potential issue with auto commit read,
  but these registers are generally not used 
  as the master is the only can read/write its own IN reg's

standard CWRM scheme perfect for master nodes if one just takes the issue described above into account!
